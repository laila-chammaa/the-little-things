my second kotlin app, so still learning!

notification-based android app with Kotlin that sends daily reminders of random acts of kindness to help strengthen your relationships with friends and family, examples:
```
Complement the next person you see on their shoes!
Remind your mom to drink water
Recommend a song you loved to a sibling
Complement the person to your right on their hair
Ask your dad how his day went
Complement a friend on a quality you like about them
Let you youngest sibling you love them and are there if they need help
Remind your mom you're grateful for having her
Let your closest friend know you appreciate their loyalty
Get your sibling a small gift
Complement the person to your left on their nails
```
